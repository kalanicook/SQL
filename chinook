# Chinook Database SQL Queries
  
# The Chinook database is a sample database representing a digital media store. It contains tables for customers, invoices, employees, tracks, artists, and more.
# The dataset is useful for practicing SQL queries related to sales, customer management, and employee performance.

# This script includes three queries:
  # 1. Retrieving invoices for customers from Brazil.
  # 2. Listing invoices associated with each sales agent.
  # 3. Identifying the top sales agent in 2009 based on total sales.

# Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil.
# The resulting table shows the customer's full name, Invoice ID, date of the invoice, and billing country.
  
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS cust 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

# Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.
# The resulting table includes the sales agent's full name.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

# Identify the sales agent who made the most dollars in sales in 2009.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices inv 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName, emp.LastName
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(inv.Total), 2) DESC
LIMIT 1;
